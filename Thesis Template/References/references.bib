abstract = {Current opinion lexicons contain most of the common opinion words, but they miss slang and so-called urban opinion words and phrases (e.g. delish, cozy, yummy, nerdy, and yuck). These subjectivity clues are frequently used in community questions and are useful for opinion question analysis. This paper introduces a principled approach to constructing an opinion lexicon for community-based question answering (cQA) services. We formulate the opinion lexicon induction as a semi-supervised learning task in the graph context. Our method makes use of existing opinion words to extract new opinion entities (slang and urban words/phrases) from community questions. It then models the opinion entities in a graph context to learn the polarity of the new opinion entities based on the graph connectivity information. In contrast to previous approaches, our method not only learns such polarities from the labeled data but also from the unlabeled data and is more feasible in the web context where the dictionary-based relations (such as synonym, antonym, or hyponym) between most words are not available for constructing a high quality graph. The experiments show that our approach is effective both in terms of the quality of the discovered new opinion entities as well as its ability in inferring their polarity. Furthermore, since the value of opinion lexicons lies in their usefulness in applications, we show the utility of the constructed lexicon in the sentiment classification task.},

This is due to its importance in a wide range of fields such as business and politics. People express sentiments about specific topics or entities with different strengths and intensities, where these sentiments are strongly related to their personal feelings and emotions. A number of methods and lexical resources have been proposed to analyze sentiment from natural language texts, addressing different opinion dimensions. In this article, we propose an approach for boosting Twitter sentiment classification using different sentiment dimensions as meta-level features. We combine aspects such as opinion strength, emotion and polarity indicators, generated by existing sentiment analysis methods and resources. Our research shows that the combination of sentiment dimensions provides significant improvement in Twitter sentiment classification tasks such as polarity and subjectivity.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe- art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification.},

This paper introduces a new source of high quality manual annotations that can be used for sentiment extraction. A subfield of sociology symbolic interactionism, more precisely Affect Control Theory (ACT), measures the emotional meanings we associate with various concepts. Research in this field produces multi-dimensional manual annotations of words much like those used in Sentiment Analysis. We compare these annotations with SentiWordNet and WordNet-Affect, lexicons produced for Sentiment Analysis, in the task of text polarity classification and show that classifier trained on the ACT lexicon outperforms the other two.},

Using three product and movie review datasets of various sizes, we show, for example, that some techniques are more beneficial for larger datasets than the smaller. A classifier trained on only few features ranked high by MI outperformed one trained on all features in large datasets, yet in small dataset this did not prove to be true.

abstract = {Microblogging services, such as Twitter, have become popular channels for people to express their opinions towards a broad range of topics. Twitter generates a huge volume of instant messages (i.e. tweets) carrying users' sentiments and attitudes every minute, which both necessitates automatic opinion summarization and poses great challenges to the summarization system. In this paper, we study the problem of opinion summarization for entities, such as celebrities and brands, in Twitter. We propose an entity-centric topic-based opinion summarization framework, which aims to produce opinion summaries in accordance with topics and remarkably emphasizing the insight behind the opinions. To this end, we first mine topics from \#hashtags, the human-annotated semantic tags in tweets. We integrate the \#hashtags as weakly supervised information into topic modeling algorithms to obtain better interpretation and representation for calculating the similarity among them, and adopt Affinity Propagation algorithm to group \#hashtags into coherent topics. Subsequently, we use templates generalized from paraphrasing to identify tweets with deep insights, which reveal reasons, express demands or reflect viewpoints. Afterwards, we develop a target (i.e. entity) dependent sentiment classification approach to identifying the opinion towards a given target (i.e. entity) of tweets. Finally, the opinion summary is generated through integrating information from dimensions of topic, opinion and insight, as well as other factors (e.g. topic relevancy, redundancy and language styles) in an unified optimization framework. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-life data set to evaluate the performance of individual opinion summarization modules as well as the quality of the produced summary. The promising experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.},

We analyzed the network structure of candidate Park and his 15 Twitter mentors during the election period (September 26, 2011 - October 26, 2011). The gathered data consists of 19,227 tweets from 8,547 users who were responded to by one of the 17 selected opinion leaders through mentions (@) or retweets (RT). To find the authorities and hubs, which play a crucial role in information propagation, the HITS algorithm was used to quantify the influence exerted by the opinion leaders. In addition, social network triads were used to identify the communication patterns between individual users on Twitter. Results of the analysis showed that the structure of the communication patterns in Twitter were mostly fragmented rather than transitive. This signi- fied that communication occurred from, or converged to, a single node, rather than circulating through multiple nodes during the election period. The majority of the network structures were fragmented, or one-way conversations. In other words, communication happened in the form of aggre- gation and propagation, rather than sharing and circulating various ideas.},

abstract = {A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. Rumors may spread misinformation (false information) or disinformation (deliberately false information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-specific memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision (MAP). Finally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.},

abstract = {This paper presents design ideas and suggestions for digital signage systems within the Tokyo transportation system to create and nurture social and community engagement around the phenomena of train suicide. This method of taking one's own life is widespread in Japan and repeatedly cripples the schedules of trains creating delays. The authors of this study have conducted field research and interviewed a number of participants on their perception of suicide in the train system and their observation of other passengers' behaviour. Our analysis has shown that a tragic act, such as suicide, offers multiple views and departure points for design. The outcomes of the paper, aside from analysis of collected data, are ideas and suggestions for designs and design guidance for particular urban spaces and insights into the design of urban systems that foster community awareness and engagement.},

abstract = {Affect Control Theory (ACT; Heise 1979, 2007) states that people control social interactions by striving to maintain culturally shared feelings about the situation. The theory is based on mathematical models of language-based impression formation. In a laboratory experiment, we tested the predictive power of a new German-language ACT model with respect to actu- al behavior and felt emotions in leadership; 60 subjects managed a computer simulated company by communicating with 3 different virtual employees (within-subjects manipula- tion). Half of the subjects were primed with the concept of authoritarian leadership using a situational interview technique; the remainder was primed with the concept of democratic leadership (between-subjects manipulation). There were 14 dependent variables (leadership categories like praise, criticize, augment salary, etc.). The German impression-formation model correctly predicted 27 of 42 between-subjects contrasts (p < .05) and 56 of 84 with- in-subjects contrasts (p < .01). Moreover, Euclidean distances of emotions predicted by the German ACT model correlated negatively with the frequency with which the subjects expe- rienced these emotions (correlations ranged from r = –.18 to r = –.61). These results sup- port Affect Control Theory’s proposition that realistic social interaction can be predicted by mathematical models of affective consistency. A},

abstract = {As data sets keep growing, computational linguists are experiencing more big data problems: challenging demands on storage and processing caused by very large data sets. An example of this is dealing with social media data: including metadata, the messages of the social media site Twitter in 2012 comprise more than 250 terabytes of structured text. Handling data volumes like this requires parallel computing architectures with appropriate software tools. In this paper we present our experiences in working with such a big data set, a collection of two billion Dutch tweets. We show how we collected and stored the data. Next we deal with searching in the data using the Hadoop framework and visualizing search results. In order to determine the usefulness of this tweet analysis resource, we have performed three case studies based on the data: relating word frequency to real-life events, finding words related to a topic, and gathering information about conversations. The three case studies are presented in this paper. Access to this current and expanding tweet data set is offered via the website twiqs.nl.},

abstract = {Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations. There are numerous natural language processing applications for which subjectivity analysis is relevant, including information extraction and text categorization. The goal of this work is learning subjective language from corpora. Clues of subjectivity are generated and tested, including low-frequency words, collocations, and adjectives and verbs identified using distributional similarity. The features are also examined working together in concert. The features, generated from different data sets using different procedures, exhibit consistency in performance in that they all do better and worse on the same data sets. In addition, this article shows that the density of subjectivity clues in the surrounding context strongly affects how likely it is that a word is subjective, and it provides the results of an annotation study assessing the subjectivity of sentences with high-density features. Finally, the clues are used to perform opinion piece recognition (a type of text categorization and genre detection) to demonstrate the utility of the knowledge acquired in this article.},

@article{Cawley2007,
abstract = {While the model parameters of a kernel machine are typically given by the solution of a convex optimisation problem, with a single global optimum, the selection of good values for the regularisation and kernel parameters is much less straightforward. Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efficiently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the benefit of this approach.},
